# Solace Container Command Builder

## Repository Purpose

When deploying the container image of Solace PubSub+ Event Brokers using a runtime such as Docker or Podman, there are numerous arguments that need to be supplied to the run command, as well as several environment variables to aid in the configuration and initialisation of those broker nodes. 

This web-based tool aims to guide a user through the various considerations to make when deploying the containers, collect user-input along the way, then generate a ready-to-go run command or compose file. 

## Running the tool
